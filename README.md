# Digital-ATM-Machine
I successfully designed and developed a Digital ATM Machine Application using Java, Swing, JFrame, and Window Builder. The primary objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and efficient ATM application that emulates the functionalities of a real-world ATM, making transactions faster and more convenient for users.

Key Features and Functionality:

1. Deposit and Withdrawal: The application allows customers to deposit and withdraw cash securely. Users can input the desired amount, and the system handles the transaction process promptly and accurately.

2. Account Balance Check: Customers can easily check their account balance by selecting the appropriate option on the ATM interface. The application retrieves and displays the current balance without any delay.

3. Money Transfer: One of the prominent features of the ATM app is the ability to transfer money between accounts. Users can transfer funds to other registered accounts within the application seamlessly.

4. PIN Change: Security is a priority, and hence, the application enables customers to change their PIN through a simple and secure process.

5. User-Friendly Interface: The project incorporates a well-designed and intuitive user interface that enhances the overall user experience. The integration of Swing and JFrame ensured an aesthetically appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.

Achievements and Outcomes:

1. Successfully implemented a fully functional ATM application that mimics real-world ATM machines.
2. Ensured the security and confidentiality of user transactions by implementing robust authentication mechanisms.
3. Optimized the application for faster response times, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
4. Received positive feedback from users during testing, acknowledging the application's ease of use and reliability.
